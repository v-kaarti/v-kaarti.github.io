- title: B.S CS, B.S. Mathematics @ University of Maryland, College Park
  from: 2022
  to: 2025
  description: I'm pursuing a dual-degree in computer science and applied mathematics here!
               I also plan on graduating in three years, and I'm a junior by credit standing.

- title: Software Engineering Intern @ Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab
  from: 2023
  to: present
  description: As a software engineering at JHU APL (with top-secret clearance), I worked on optimizing aerodynamic simulations. I used Python (and its various libraries, e.g., scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, etc.) to write production-quality programs that efficiently approximated complex physical simulations (like computational fluid dynamics). To supplement these programs, I created beautiful visualizations for the topic experts to interpret. I also used performant C++ to implement various algorithms from bleeding-edge research papers in the field.


- title: Software Engineer @ Hack4Impact
  from: 2023
  to: present
  description: As an engineer at Hack4Impact, I created interactive web apps using TypeScript and the MERN stack. I met with nonprofit clients to architect project specifications, and I worked in teams of 6+ using the Agile process in two-week sprints. Ultimately, my contributions to modern UI/UX design and finer ease-of-access significantly increased organic traffic to client websites.

- title: ML/AI Research Intern @ NonExomics
  from: 2020
  to: 2022
  description: As a machine learning research intern at NonExomics, I was responsible for engineering complex predictive models that took in swathes of disconnected genetic information and churned out accurate, medical-industry-grade disease diagnoses. I used Python (alongside PyTorch, scikit-learn, and other ML/DL and data science libraries) to write high-performance code running on AWS Ubuntu instances. Among my projects were a cancer-prediction algorithm based on VCF (variant call format) data and a hereditary disease indicator based on previously unexplored regions of the human genome.
